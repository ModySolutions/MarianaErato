Él quiso aprovechar la situación, y comenzó a besarme, no recuerdo negarme a eso, pero luego, quería que pasara a algo más. Yo no había tenido ninguna experiencia sexual hasta el momento, y era bastante ignorante en el tema. Me dio miedo y no sabía cómo pararlo. Le dije que no suavemente un par de veces, él insistió, y como una niña que no tenía herramientas para gestionar dicha situación, lo único que se me ocurrió fue darle la espalda, como señal de que quería que me dejase tranquila.
